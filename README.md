- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mattman812
- I have been a software engeneer since 2014.  I am adding this git repository just to store some old code that I may or may not work again.
- Also, some very old home work assignments.  lol 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m have a wide range of interests and find full stack developemnt the most interesting.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning angular.  Been on 13 and may post some stuff to this repo.
